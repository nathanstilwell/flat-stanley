# When Flat Stanley Comes to visit

Sometimes my younger relatives send me a flat Stanley. When they do Elizabeth
and I usually take him around town and take pictures and go on adventures. To
document these visits I've created a repository. The default "site" will be
the last visit, but I'll keep the others broken up by folder for posterity.
